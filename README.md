# Games Catalogue First Project

## A simple games catalogue that shows owned and wishlisted games

This project aims to make a simple application that lets you browse owned and wishlisted games.

What this Project aims to be able to do:

- add my games to the catalog (local, add one game at a time)
- show my games in a list (grid view)
- edit game details (saving them)
- delete games from either list

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
